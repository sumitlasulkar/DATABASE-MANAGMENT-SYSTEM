🔹 SQL Operators
🔹 SQL Operators
    1. Arithmetic Operators – For mathematical calculations
        + → Addition
        - → Subtraction
        * → Multiplication
        / → Division
        % → Modulus (remainder)
    2. Comparison / Relational Operators – For comparing values
        = → Equal to
        != or <> → Not equal to
        > → Greater than
        < → Less than
        >= → Greater than or equal to
        <= → Less than or equal to
    3. Logical Operators – For combining conditions
        AND → True if all conditions are true
        OR → True if any condition is true
        NOT → Reverses the result
    4. Special Operators – For advanced filtering

        IN → Checks if value matches a list of values
        LIKE → Used for pattern matching
        IS NULL → Checks for NULL values


🔹" Constraints in SQL : used to specify rules for data in a table "
🔹 Column-level Constraints
Applied directly with the column definition.
Examples: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT.
🔹 Table-level Constraints
Applied separately after all columns are defined.
Examples: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, UNIQUE.

    NOT NULL → Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
    UNIQUE → Ensures all values in a column are different.
    PRIMARY KEY → Uniquely identifies each row (NOT NULL + UNIQUE).
    FOREIGN KEY → Links a column to the primary key of another table.
    CHECK → Ensures that values satisfy a specific condition.
    DEFAULT → Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

🔹 Modifying tables : done using alter keys

🔹 Clause in SQL 
 A clause is a part of an SQL query that adds a condition or modifies how data is selected, grouped, or ordered.
    WHERE → Filters rows based on a condition.
    HAVING → Filters groups after aggregation.
    GROUP BY → Groups rows based on one or more columns.
    ORDER BY → Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
    FROM → Specifies the table to retrieve data from.
    SELECT → Specifies the columns to be retrieved.


🔹 View 
 A virtual table in SQL created using a query that shows data from one or more tables without storing it separately.
    🔹 Features
    Stores only the query, not the actual data.
    Provides security by restricting access to specific columns/rows.
    Simplifies complex queries.
    Can be updated (with some restrictions).

Simple View → Created from a single table without functions or group clauses.
Complex View → Created from multiple tables using joins, functions, or group clauses.
Materialized View → Stores the actual data physically and refreshes periodically for performance.
Updatable View → A view in which INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations can be performed 
Read-only View → A view where data modification is not allowed 

✅ Advantages of Views
    Simplicity → Hides complex queries behind a single view.
    Security → Restricts user access to specific rows/columns.
    Reusability → Can be reused in multiple queries.
    Data Abstraction → Provides a logical representation without exposing the base table.
    Consistency → Ensures users see the same, uniform data output.

❌ Disadvantages of Views
    Performance Overhead → Complex views can slow down query execution.
    Read-only Limitations → Many views cannot be updated (joins, aggregates, etc.).
    Dependency Issues → Dropping/changing base tables may break views.
    Storage (Materialized Views) → Requires extra space to store data.
    Restricted Operations → Some DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are not allowed on certain views.


🔹 Index 
An Index in SQL is a database object used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table, just like an index in a book helps you find information quickly.

    🔹 Types of Indexes
    Primary Index → Created automatically on the Primary Key column.
    Unique Index → Ensures all values in a column are unique.
    Clustered Index → Physically arranges the data in the table (only one per table).
    Non-Clustered Index → Creates a separate structure pointing to the data (can be many per table).
    Composite Index → Index on two or more columns together.
    Implicit Index → Automatically created when constraints like PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE are applied.

    🔹 Advantages
    Faster data retrieval (improves SELECT performance).
    Useful for searching, sorting, and filtering large datasets.
    Helps enforce constraints like uniqueness.

    🔹 Disadvantages
    Takes extra space in the database.
    Slows down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE (because index must be updated too).
    Needs maintenance.


🔹 Sequence
A Sequence in SQL is a database object that generates a sequence of numeric values automatically (often used for auto-incrementing primary keys).

    🔹 Key Points
    Generates unique numbers in order.
    Can be incremented up or down.
    Has options for start value, increment, min, max, cycle.
    Often used for IDs, invoice numbers, serial numbers.

    🔹 Advantages
        Automatically generates unique numbers.
        Removes need for manual number entry.
        Ensures no duplicates for primary keys.



🔹 Set operations
  Set operations in SQL are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries.
    🔹 Set Operations in SQL 
    UNION → Combines results of two queries, removes duplicates.
    UNION ALL → Combines results of two queries, keeps duplicates.
    INTERSECT → Returns only common rows between two queries.
    EXCEPT / MINUS → Returns rows from first query that are not in second.
    EXCEPT ALL → Returns rows from first query not in second but keeps duplicates.
    🔹 Rules for Set Operations
        Same Number of Columns → Both SELECT queries must return the same number of columns.
        Same Data Types → Data types of corresponding columns must be compatible (e.g., INT with INT, VARCHAR with VARCHAR).
        Order of Columns → Columns are compared based on their order, not names.
        Column Names → Final result set takes column names from the first SELECT query.
        Sorting → ORDER BY can be used only once at the end of the combined query (not in individual SELECTs).
        Duplicates →
            UNION and INTERSECT → remove duplicates.
            UNION ALL and EXCEPT ALL → keep duplicates.
        NULL Handling → NULL is treated as a valid value during set operations (e.g., NULL = NULL for comparison).


🔹 Join
Join in SQL → Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
    🔹 Types of Joins
    INNER JOIN → Returns only matching rows from both tables.
    LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN) → Returns all rows from the left table + matching rows from the right.
    RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN) → Returns all rows from the right table + matching rows from the left.
    FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN) → Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
    CROSS JOIN → Returns Cartesian product (every row of table1 × every row of table2).
    SELF JOIN → A table joins with itself.
    NATURAL JOIN → Automatically joins based on columns with the same name in both tables.
    EQUI JOIN → A join condition using = operator.
    NON-EQUI JOIN → A join condition using >, <, BETWEEN, etc.

🔹 1. Join Condition
Definition: The condition that specifies how two tables are related when performing a join.
Usually based on matching columns like primary key → foreign key.
Determines which rows are combined from the tables.
🔹 2. Join Predicate
Definition: A logical expression used to filter rows in a join.
Can include comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=, <>) and logical operators (AND, OR).
Helps limit the result set after applying the join condition.
    "EQUI JOIN" → A join using the = operator between columns of two tables.
    "NON-EQUI JOIN" → A join using other comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, <>) instead of =.
    "MULTIPLE JOIN CONDITIONS" → Join with more than one condition using AND / OR in the ON clause.


🔹 Set Membership
Set Membership refers to checking whether a value exists in a set of values or satisfies a condition within a set returned by a subquery.

        🔹 Types of Set Membership
        IN → Checks if a value matches any value in a list or subquery.
        NOT IN → Checks if a value does not match any value in a list or subquery.
        ANY / SOME → Checks if a value matches any value returned by a subquery (can use comparison operators).
        ALL → Checks if a value satisfies a condition for all values returned by a subquery.


🔹Tuple Variable
Tuple Variable → An alias given to a table or row in a query to reference it easily, especially in self-joins or complex queries.
    Helps differentiate multiple instances of the same table.
    Makes queries shorter and more readable.
    Tuple variables are aliases for tables or rows.
    Required in self-joins to distinguish table instances.
    Can simplify queries with long table names.
    Improves readability and maintainability of SQL code.


🔹 Aggregate Functions : perform calculation on set of values, returns a single value
    COUNT() : count the values
    MAX() :give max value
    MIN(): give min value
    SUM() : give sum of all values
    AVG() : give average of all values

    STRING_AGG() → combines strings, requires separator.
    STDDEV() → measures dispersion from mean, sqrt of variance.
    VARIANCE() → measures data spread, square of std deviation.
    Useful in statistical and reporting queries.

🔹 Nested Subquery
 → A query inside another query (usually inside SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses).
The inner query runs first and its result is used by the outer query.
Also called subquery or inner query.
    🔹 Types of Nested Subqueries
    Single-row subquery → Returns one value.
    Multiple-row subquery → Returns multiple values.
    Multiple-column subquery → Returns multiple columns.
    Correlated subquery → Inner query depends on outer query.
